# Movie Page

## Description
- I'm did this with BootStrap framework.
- If you are interested, here's the link : https://getbootstrap.com.
- Overall i used the `NavBar` for the `header` and the `cards` for my movie description.
- I use too the `Container` class for the web page body and the `row` with columns(`col`) to separate the cards.
- Hope you enjoy with this.
